3.  Introduction

   The Secure Mobile Vault Format (SMVF) defines a binary container
   format for storing encrypted password vaults on mobile devices.  The
   format is designed to be offline-first, zero-knowledge,
   cryptographically robust, and forward-compatible.

   SMVF follows strict principles including explicit headers, typed
   sections, cryptographic framing, and strict versioning, while
   remaining minimal and suitable for mobile environments.

4.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

5.  Design Goals

   The format is designed to meet the following goals:

   1.  Provide zero-knowledge encryption where vault contents cannot be
       recovered without the master password.

   2.  Support offline-only operation with no network dependencies.

   3.  Be safe for mobile storage, including crash-safe atomic updates.

   4.  Use authenticated encryption to ensure confidentiality and
       integrity.

   5.  Allow future evolution without breaking existing vaults.

   6.  Remain auditable and deterministic in layout.

6.  File Overview

   An SMVF file consists of the following components, in order:

   *  File Header (fixed-size)

   *  KDF Parameters Section

   *  Crypto Parameters Section

   *  Encrypted Vault Section

   *  Optional Footer

   All multi-octet integer fields are encoded in network byte order
   (big-endian).  The file is tightly packed and contains no padding.

   The standard file extension is ".smvf".

7.  File Header

   The file header is a fixed-size structure of 32 octets.

   The header contains the following fields:

   *  Magic (4 octets) Identifies the file as an SMVF container.  The
      value MUST be the ASCII string "SMVF".

   *  Major Version (2 octets) Indicates the major format version.
      Readers MUST reject files with unsupported major versions.

   *  Minor Version (2 octets) Indicates backward-compatible revisions.

   *  Header Length (4 octets) Total length in octets of all sections
      except the Encrypted Vault Section length preceding the encrypted
      payload.

   *  Flags (4 octets) Bitmask defining file properties.

   *  File UUID (16 octets) Randomly generated UUID version 4 identifier
      as defined in [RFC9562].  This value is non-secret and MUST NOT be
      reused.

   The following header flags are defined:

   *  Bit 0: Encrypted payload present (MUST be set)

   *  Bit 1: Footer present

   *  Bits 2-31: Reserved and MUST be zero

8.  Section Model

   Sections follow a typed-length-value (TLV) model.

   Each section consists of:

   *  Section Type (2 octets)

   *  Section Length (4 octets)

   *  Section Value (variable length)

   The section length specifies the length of the section value only.

   Unknown section types MUST be skipped using the length field.  The
   section order defined in this specification MUST be preserved.

9.  Section Types

   The following section types are defined:

   *  0x0001: KDF Parameters Section (REQUIRED)

   *  0x0002: Crypto Parameters Section (REQUIRED)

   *  0x0003: Encrypted Vault Section (REQUIRED)

   *  0x0004-0x7FFF: Reserved for future use and MUST NOT be used

   No section identifier may be reused for a different purpose.

10.  KDF Parameters Section

   This section defines how the encryption key is derived from the
   master password.

   The section value contains the following fields:

   *  KDF Algorithm (1 octet)

   *  Salt Length (1 octet)

   *  Salt (variable length)

   *  Cost Parameter A (4 octets)

   *  Cost Parameter B (4 octets)

   *  Cost Parameter C (4 octets)

   The following KDF Algorithm identifiers are defined:

   *  0x01: Argon2id as defined in [RFC9106]

   *  0x02: scrypt as defined in [RFC7914]

   *  0x03-0x7F: Reserved for future use and MUST NOT be used

   The salt is not secret and MUST be generated randomly per vault.

   For Argon2id, the parameters are defined as follows:

   *  Parameter A: Memory cost in KiB

   *  Parameter B: Iteration count

   *  Parameter C: Degree of parallelism

   For scrypt, the parameters are defined as follows:

   *  Parameter A: N (CPU/memory cost)

   *  Parameter B: r

   *  Parameter C: p

   Implementations SHOULD tune parameters for mobile hardware while
   maintaining resistance to offline attacks.

11.  Crypto Parameters Section

   This section defines the encryption algorithm and parameters used to
   protect the vault payload.

   The section value contains the following fields:

   *  Cipher Algorithm (1 octet)

   *  Key Length (1 octet)

   *  Nonce Length (1 octet)

   *  Authentication Tag Length (1 octet)

   *  Nonce (variable length)

   The following Cipher Algorithm identifiers are defined:

   *  0x01: AES-256-GCM as defined in [RFC4106]

   *  0x02: ChaCha20-Poly1305 as defined in [RFC8439]

   *  0x03-0x7F: Reserved for future use and MUST NOT be used

   For AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, the Key Length MUST be 32
   octets.

   Implementations MUST ensure that a nonce is never reused with the
   same derived key.  The authentication tag is embedded in the AEAD
   ciphertext and is not stored separately.

12.  Encrypted Vault Section

   This section contains the encrypted vault payload.

   The payload is produced using an AEAD construction with the following
   inputs:

   *  The encryption key is derived from the master password using the
      KDF Parameters Section.

   *  The nonce is taken from the Crypto Parameters Section.

   *  The additional authenticated data consists of the File Header, the
      KDF Parameters Section, and the Crypto Parameters Section.

   All metadata is authenticated but not encrypted.  Any modification to
   these components MUST cause decryption failure.

   The AAD input MUST be the exact serialized octet sequence of the File
   Header followed by the serialized KDF Parameters Section and the
   serialized Crypto Parameters Section, in file order.

13.  Vault Payload Structure

   Before encryption, the vault payload is serialized JSON as defined in
   [RFC8259].  All JSON strings MUST be encoded in UTF-8.

   No canonicalization of the JSON payload is required, as integrity is
   provided by the enclosing AEAD construction.

   The top-level object contains the following fields:

   *  vault_version: Integer indicating the logical vault schema version

   *  created: [RFC3339] timestamp

   *  updated: [RFC3339] timestamp

   *  entries: Array of vault entries

   *  metadata: Optional application-defined metadata

14.  Vault Entry Structure

   Each vault entry is a [RFC8259] JSON object containing the following
   fields:

   *  id: UUID version 4 string as defined in [RFC9562]

   *  type: Entry type identifier

   *  title: Human-readable name

   *  fields: Key-value mapping of entry fields

   *  notes: Optional freeform text

   *  tags: Optional array of strings

   *  created: [RFC3339] timestamp

   *  updated: [RFC3339] timestamp

   The type field allows future extension to support non-password
   secrets.

15.  Authentication and Integrity

   The format relies exclusively on AEAD for security guarantees.

   The following properties are provided:

   *  Confidentiality of vault contents

   *  Integrity of vault contents

   *  Integrity and authenticity of metadata

   No separate MAC or digital signature is required.

16.  Atomic Update Requirements

   Implementations MUST perform updates atomically to prevent vault
   corruption.

   A recommended procedure is as follows:

   1.  Write the updated vault to a temporary file.

   2.  Flush and synchronize the file.

   3.  Atomically rename the temporary file over the existing vault.

   4.  Optionally retain a backup copy.

   Mobile operating systems guarantee atomic rename operations within
   the same filesystem.

17.  Memory Handling Requirements

   Implementations MUST enforce the following requirements:

   *  Derived encryption keys MUST NOT be persisted.

   *  Keys MUST be zeroized on lock or application backgrounding.

   *  Decrypted vault data MUST reside only in memory and MUST be
      discarded on lock or suspension.

18.  Forward Compatibility Rules

   Readers MUST reject files with unsupported major versions.

   Readers MUST ignore unknown section types.

   Writers MUST preserve section ordering and MUST NOT reuse section
   identifiers.

19.  Explicit Non-Goals

   The format intentionally excludes:

   *  Cloud synchronization

   *  Compression

   *  Partial encryption

   *  Password reuse detection

   *  Replay protection

20.  Threat Model Summary

   The format mitigates:

   *  Offline file theft

   *  Unauthorized modification

   *  Metadata tampering

   The format does not mitigate:

   *  Compromised or rooted operating systems

   *  Active runtime memory attacks

   *  Screen capture malware

21.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

22.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a cryptographic container format intended to
   protect sensitive data at rest.  Security properties and assumptions
   are discussed throughout the document, including key derivation,
   authenticated encryption, and memory handling requirements.

   The format assumes a trusted execution environment and does not
   protect against compromised operating systems, runtime memory
   disclosure, or malicious software with sufficient privileges.
   Implementers are responsible for selecting appropriate cryptographic
   parameters and ensuring correct use of underlying cryptographic
   primitives.
